# Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) Project

This project implements a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system using Python. It utilizes the RAVDESS dataset to classify emotions expressed in spoken language.

## Introduction

Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a technology that identifies and classifies emotions in spoken language. This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of SER using machine learning techniques.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `librosa`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `tensorflow` or `keras` (if using deep learning models)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn librosa matplotlib tensorflow

## Dataset
This project uses the RAVDESS dataset for training and testing the emotion recognition model. Make sure to download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.
