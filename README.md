# Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) Project

This project implements a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system using Python. It utilizes the RAVDESS dataset to classify emotions expressed in spoken language.

## Introduction

Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a technology that identifies and classifies emotions in spoken language. This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of SER using machine learning techniques.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `librosa`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `tensorflow` or `keras` (if using deep learning models)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn librosa matplotlib tensorflow

## Dataset
This project uses the RAVDESS dataset for training and testing the emotion recognition model. Make sure to download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.

Here are the steps to download the RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song) dataset online:
Go to the official website of the RAVDESS dataset: https://smartlaboratory.org/ravdess/
On the website, scroll down to the "Download" section.
There are two options for downloading the dataset:
Option 1: Download the entire dataset (Audio_Speech_Actors_01-24.zip and Audio_Song_Actors_01-24.zip)
Option 2: Download individual ZIP files for each actor (e.g., Actor_01.zip, Actor_02.zip, etc.)
Choose the option that suits your needs and click on the corresponding download link(s).
After clicking the download link(s), you may be prompted to save the file(s) or open them directly in your web browser. Choose the "Save File" option to download the ZIP file(s) to your local machine.
Once the download is complete, you can extract the contents of the ZIP file(s) to access the audio files and other data associated with the RAVDESS dataset.


## Installation
Clone the repository:
bash


Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SER_Project.git
cd SER_Project
Download the RAVDESS dataset and place it in the data/ directory.


run the ser-real_time.ipynd file
